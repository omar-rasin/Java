### **Practice Questions**

1. Write a program that takes two integers as input and divides the first by the second. Use exception handling to manage `ArithmeticException` (division by zero).
2. Create a method that throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the input string is empty. Use `throw` and `throws`.
3. Write a program that reads a file using `Scanner`. Handle `FileNotFoundException`.
