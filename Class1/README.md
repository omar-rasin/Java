## 7. **Practice Questions**

1. Write a Java class `Person` with fields `name`, `age`, and a method `displayInfo()` that prints the person's information. Create an object of this class in `Main` and call the method.

2. Create a class `Book` with fields `title`, `author`, and `price`. Write a constructor to initialize these fields, and create a method `displayDetails()` to print the bookâ€™s details. Create two objects of the class `Book` and print their details.

3. Write a Java program with a class `Rectangle` that has fields `length` and `width`. Add a method `calculateArea()` that returns the area of the rectangle. Create objects for two rectangles and display their areas.

4. Create a `Student` class with fields `name` and `marks`. Write a method `isPassed()` that returns `true` if the marks are greater than 50, and `false` otherwise. Instantiate a student object in the `main` method and check if the student has passed.

5. Create a class `Dog` with fields `breed`, `age`, and `color`. Write a method `bark()` that prints "Woof!" when called. Instantiate multiple `Dog` objects and call the `bark()` method for each.
