## Practice Questions

1. Write a program where a `Person` class has attributes `name` and `age`. Create a subclass `Employee` that adds an `employeeId` attribute and a method `displayEmployeeInfo()`.

2. Create a superclass `Vehicle` with an attribute `speed` and methods `start()` and `stop()`. Create two subclasses `Car` and `Bike` that inherit from `Vehicle` and override the `start()` and `stop()` methods.

3. Implement multilevel inheritance with the classes `Person`, `Student`, and `GraduateStudent`. The `GraduateStudent` class should inherit from `Student`, which in turn inherits from `Person`.

4. Write a program that demonstrates hierarchical inheritance with a superclass `Shape` and subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle`. Each subclass should have its own method for calculating the area.
