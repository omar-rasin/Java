### WEEK 3_1: Practice Questions on Java Programming Concepts

1. **Basic Variable Declaration**
   - Write a Java program that declares two integer variables, assigns values to them, and prints their sum.

2. **Simple If-Else Statement**
   - Create a program that takes an integer input from the user and checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero. Print an appropriate message based on the result.

3. **Switch Statement**
   - Write a program that takes an integer input representing a month (1-12) and prints the corresponding month name (e.g., 1 = January, 2 = February, etc.) using a switch statement.

4. **For Loop**
   - Write a program that uses a for loop to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

5. **While Loop**
   - Create a program that uses a while loop to print all the odd numbers between 1 and 20.

6. **Do-While Loop**
   - Write a program that prompts the user for a number and continues to print that number until the user enters zero, using a do-while loop.
